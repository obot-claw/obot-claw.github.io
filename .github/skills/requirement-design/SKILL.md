# Requirement Design

Adapted from [gsm.roadmap's requirement-design skill](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm.roadmap/blob/main/.github/skills/requirement-design/SKILL.md) for this hub.

## When to Use

- A Requirement issue has Business Requirement and Overview populated and is ready for design
- Drafting or revising the **Design** section of a Requirement issue
- Creating a long-form design artifact at `requirements/design/{issue_number}_design.html`

## Procedure

1. **Read the requirement issue** (`gh issue view` — live body, not a stale draft) and confirm:
   - **Business Requirement** and **Overview** are populated (required at creation).
   - **Data Requirement** is populated, or the requirement is clearly not data-dependent. If the gap matters, surface it before proceeding — Design depends on it.
   - The issue carries `type:requirement` and a `project:P###` label.

2. **Identify affected repos** — typically a subset of: `safety.viz`, `gsm.safety`, `safety-agent`, `safety-histogram` and the other renderer forks. Check existing open issues in those repos for overlap. Architecture references live outside the org (`Gilead-BioStats/rbm-viz`, `Gilead-BioStats/gsm.kri`).

3. **Decide where the design lives:**
   - **Simple requirement** → fill the Design section directly in the issue body (`Summary`, `Affected repos`, `Design artifacts`).
   - **Complex requirement** → create `requirements/design/{issue_number}_design.html` in this repo, add the long-form design there, and reference it from the issue's Design section.

4. **Draft the design** covering:
   - Summary of the approach
   - Affected repos
   - Key technical components or changes
   - Dependencies on other requirements, data sources, or upstream repos
   - Open questions

   **Format:** design documents are self-contained HTML pages (decided 2026-07-02;
   see `requirements/design/README.md`) so they render directly on the hub site at
   `https://obot-claw.github.io/requirements/design/{issue_number}_design.html`.
   Use the site palette, include a status line (`Draft` / `Signed off`) and an
   attribution line, and keep everything in the one file — no external CSS/JS
   beyond web fonts.

5. **Present the draft for review** and iterate. Design changes to the issue body go through `gh issue edit --body-file` (draft-sync convention). Verify Design is signed off before decomposing the work — then hand off to [`requirement-tasks`](../requirement-tasks/SKILL.md).
